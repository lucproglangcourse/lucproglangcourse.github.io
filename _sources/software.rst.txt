Appendix: Course Software
-------------------------

You can choose either or both of the following options.


Cloud-based development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option is recommended if you have any problems with your local setup or if you prefer a basic cloud-based setup.


Pros
````

- consistent, cloud-based environment


Cons
````

- requires good network connection
- might lack code completion

Zero-install option
```````````````````

Scastie is an interactive playground for Scala with support for Scala 3 and sbt (Scala Build Tool) configuration.
It allows you to save code snippets to your GitHub account, which you can access later.
It is not suitable for working on full-fledged Scala projects, however.

To launch, visit https://scastie.scala-lang.org.
Be sure to

- choose target Scala 3 and Scala version 3.0.1
- add the following `scalacOptions` under build settings::

    "-Yexplicit-nulls",
    "-language:strictEquality"


Locally installed development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option will give you an advanced development environment with code completion, type info, etc.


Pros
````

- provides powerful capabilities, including code completion
- does not require network connection once installed


Cons
````

- might be slow on older machines
- need to maintain on each machine you use
- it can be challenging to match the versions of the various packages


Required packages
`````````````````

- `Java 11 and/or newer JDK <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/>`_
- `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ distributed version control system (usually preinstalled on Mac OS and Linux)

  - recommended installation option on Windows: *Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt*
  - optional on any plaDecimaltform, especially when not using IntelliJ IDEA: `some GUI-based Git client <https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis>`_


- `sbt <https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html>`_ Scala build tool
- `VisualVM <https://visualvm.github.io/>`_ visual heap profiling tool
- *Mac and Linux users are strongly encouraged to use* `SDKMAN! <https://sdkman.io/>`_ *to manage their Java, sbt, VisualVM, and other command-line development tools.*


Choices of development environments
```````````````````````````````````

- `IntelliJ IDEA CE <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/>`_ integrated development environment (recommended)

  - check specific prerequisite details for your platform
  - for the following steps, make sure you have no projects open and are looking at the welcome window as in the attached screenshot
  - *Scala plugin installation:* IntelliJ IDEA > Configure (bottom right) > Plugins > Browse repositories > find and right-click Scala > download and install > close repository browser > OK to restart IDEA
    Because Scala 3 is still evolving, JetBrains recommend setting the IntelliJ Scala plugin to the nightly channel for more frequent updates. For details, visit `this blog post <https://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2020/03/17/scala-3-support-in-intellij-scala-plugin/>`_.
  - *JDK configuration*: IntelliJ IDEA > Configure > Project Defaults > Project Structure > Platform Settings > SDKs > + > JDK > navigate to the installation directory of your most recent JDK > OK

- `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ alternative based on your preference and/or experience

  - it should offer to install Scala support when you open a Scala project folder for the first time
  - `discussion of IDEA vs VS Code for Scala development <https://stackoverflow.com/a/61156424>`_

- conventional text editor

  - Emacs
  - vim
  - etc.


sbt optional plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section applies to all uses of sbt, whether cloud-based or on the local command line.

These are useful additional sbt plugins. `You can install them per project or globally. <http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Using-Plugins.html>`_ Many of the example projects already come with one or more of these plugins (especially the first two).

- `sbt-native-packager <https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager>`_: creates a script for running your app outside sbt
- `sbt-scoverage <https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage>`_: uses Scoverage to produce a test code coverage report
- `sbt-updates <https://github.com/rtimush/sbt-updates>`_: checks central repos for dependency updates
- `sbt-scalafmt <https://github.com/scalameta/sbt-scalafmt>`_: automatic source code formatting using `Scalafmt <https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/>`_
- `scalastyle <https://github.com/scalastyle/scalastyle-sbt-plugin>`_: static code checker for Scala
- `wart remover <https://github.com/wartremover/wartremover>`_: code linting tool (another static checker)


GitHub
~~~~~~

`GitHub <https://github.com>`_ is a provider of hosted Git repositories, which emphasizes community and collaboration. For this reason, we use it to host our course examples.

- Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
- Get the `GitHub Student Developer Pack <https://education.github.com/pack/join>`_ using your official ``@luc.edu`` address. This will give you free unlimited private repositories.
- Find and follow a few practitioners you respect. For example, I follow `these developers <https://github.com/klaeufer/following>`_. You'll probably recognize a number of them.
- Review `these notes <https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source>`_ to understand the community-based development process.
- For credit toward class participation, create some meaningful `GitHub issues <https://guides.github.com/features/issues>`_ and/or `GitHub pull requests <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_ for one or more of our `course examples <https://github.com/lucproglangcourse>`_. (Make sure to navigate to the original repos as these forks do not have their own issue trackers). These can be functional or nonfunctional enhancements, requests for clarification, etc.
- To enhance your visibility in the professional community, start doing the same for some open-source projects you are interested in.

You may find both of these cheat sheets useful:

- `GitHub <https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf>`_
- `GitLab <https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/git-cheat-sheet.pdf>`_ (includes useful diagrams)


Remote participation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This software allows you to participating in class remotely in case of weather emergencies, pandemics, etc.
For security and privacy reasons, be sure to update it frequently.

- `Zoom <https://luc.zoom.us>`_

In case of a Zoom outage, we will fall back to MS Teams chat and reorganize from there.
