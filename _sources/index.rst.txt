Welcome!
In this course, we study programming language concepts and paradigms in the context of contemporary software engineering practice. 
This version of the course is normally taught by `Konstantin LÃ¤ufer <https://github.com/klaeufer>`_ and focuses on functional and concurrent programming languages with examples and projects mostly in Scala.
